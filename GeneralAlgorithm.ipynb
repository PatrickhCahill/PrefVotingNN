    "# 3. Outline of Australian Preferential Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In Australia, the House of Representatives which determines the\n",
    "government is elected using preferential voting, also known as ranked\n",
    "choice voting. In the 2022 election, there were 151 division, which each\n",
    "elected a single member to represent them in the House. In each\n",
    "division, voters are given a ballot which contains all of the candidates\n",
    "standing in the election to be a member of that division. Voters than\n",
    "rank their preferences of who they would prefer to have elected. The\n",
    "first choice receives a $1$ there second choice a $2$ and so on until\n",
    "*all* the candidates have been exhausted.[^1] In principle, to determine\n",
    "who is elected the Australian Electoral Commission performs the\n",
    "following process\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Count all of the first preferences of each of the candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If no one has 50% of the preferences, the lowest candidates is\n",
    "    eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The voters who's first preference was eliminated then have their\n",
    "    second preferences distributed among the remaining candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The process of elimination and distribution of preferences is\n",
    "    continued until one candidate has greater than 50% of the vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  The person with greater than 50% of the vote after some number of\n",
    "    eliminations is then elected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2. Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of eliminating the lowest ranked candidate and distributing\n",
    "all their preferences requires that first preference count be absolutely\n",
    "complete before the elimination is complete. This takes time, not least\n",
    "because postal can arrive after election (so long as they were posted in\n",
    "time) and because processes to ensure the correct entry of preferences\n",
    "take time. The AEC perform preference distributions by entering the\n",
    "ballot results into a database a computer programme performs the\n",
    "preference flows. This process takes many days and voters and the media\n",
    "want indictive results on election night or as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3. Two Candidate Preferred\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in practice, the AEC performs a preliminary count at voting\n",
    "booths on election night. Booth volunteers perform two counts. One count\n",
    "is of the candidates primary (first preference) vote, the other count is\n",
    "the two candidate preferred. The two candidate preferred count is\n",
    "special. The AEC prior to counting nominate two candidates that they\n",
    "estimate will most likely be the final two after all the elimination\n",
    "processes are complete. A count is then performed between these two\n",
    "candidates. A vote for candidate $A$ occurs when a voters has a lower\n",
    "preference number for $A$ then for $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4. Two Party Preferred\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of Australian history election have been contested between the\n",
    "Liberal/National Coalition (LNP/Liberals) and the Australian Labor Party\n",
    "(LAB/Labor). The two party system meant that often almost all the seats\n",
    "in the house were occupied by members of the two **major** parties, with\n",
    "only a handful of independents and rarely any third parties, until the\n",
    "2022 election. Because almost all contests in each division have\n",
    "historically been between the Liberals and Labor it has historically\n",
    "made sense to refer to contests where the TCP is between a Labor\n",
    "candidate and a Liberal candidate as a measurement of the two parties'\n",
    "preferred preferences (TPP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.1. Usefulness of TPP\n",
    "\n",
    "TPP has been a very useful shorthand for measuring the major parties'\n",
    "respective political support among the electorate. For example, in the\n",
    "2007 election, Labor received 43% of the primary vote while the\n",
    "Coalition received 42%. This would suggest a close election, after all\n",
    "the primary votes are very close between the two parties. In fact, the\n",
    "result was a landslide victory for the Labor Party. The ALP received 64%\n",
    "of the preference flow from other voters resulting in TPP of 52.7 of\n",
    "Labor - a much clearer sign of support for the primary vote. TPP is\n",
    "therefore a useful measure of the support of the major parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.2. TPP in 2022 Election\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2022 election, the Labor party won a majority of seats\n",
    "(divisions) in the house of representatives with a record low primary\n",
    "vote of 32.6% (actually going backwards from the previous election they\n",
    "lost), as did the Coalition on 35.7% primary vote. Many pundits leading\n",
    "up to the election declared that it was not possible to form a majority\n",
    "government on the back of such low primary support. In fact that Labor\n",
    "won a slim majority with a TPP of 52.13%. Some pundits clearly\n",
    "misunderstood the nature of preferential voting - many voters voted for\n",
    "the progressive Greens Party (12.25%) and then preference the ALP above\n",
    "the Coalition. On election night journalists bemoaned the demise of the\n",
    "two party system, failing to realise that voters used the preferential\n",
    "system to full effect for the first time. The 2022 election should be a\n",
    "celebration of democracy and the fact that voters were both able to make\n",
    "the primary intentions and desires for the leadership of the country\n",
    "heard, while at the same time having a say of the two men with a\n",
    "reasonable chance of becoming Prime Minister.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting aside much of the misunderstanding about the preferential system\n",
    "by journalists the TPP result does have a few problems. In 2022, the\n",
    "Coalition recorded a TPP of 47.87% but only 58 seats. By contrast, in\n",
    "the 2007 election the Coalition had an even lower TPP of 47.3% but won\n",
    "65 seats. This was first time the election was not entirely a\n",
    "**two-party contest**. Independents and the Greens both recorded large\n",
    "swings towards them - winning seats off both major parties, but\n",
    "primarily the Coalition. The combined \\\"Others\\\" vote in the 2022\n",
    "election was just below a third.\n",
    "\n",
    "On election night, in seats such as Macnamara, Griffith and Brisbane 3\n",
    "Candidate Preferred (3CP) results were calculated on election night.\n",
    "Some work since has been done on 3CP contests.[^2] In all three seats,\n",
    "the final 3 candidates would clearly be the Liberal Party, Labor, and\n",
    "the Greens. Because Labor and the Greens have strong preference flows to\n",
    "one another (both are progressive ideologically) it was clear that the\n",
    "Liberals could not win any of the seats. But the order of the 3 parties\n",
    "were important in determining the final winner. For example, the results\n",
    "in Brisbane[^3] are displayed in Figure\n",
    "[\\[tab:2022Brisbane\\]](#tab:2022Brisbane){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"tab:2022Brisbane\"}. While Labor came second on primary votes,\n",
    "a strong primary flow from the Animal Justice Party (AJP) to the Greens\n",
    "and weak preference flows to Labor meant the Greens took second place in\n",
    "the 3CP count. Labor was then eliminated from the count and Greens\n",
    "elected on Labor preferences ahead of the LNP candidate. This race for\n",
    "second place occurred in Macnamara (Labor eventually won) and Griffith\n",
    "(Greens won). In all three cases, a simple forecasting model that\n",
    "operated on TPP swing was clearly inadequate. The fact Labor started\n",
    "ahead of the Greens on primary votes and that the Green's won the\n",
    "election from third place shows that a forecasting model cannot be\n",
    "complete without attention given to the preference system.\n",

    "# 4. Forecasting The Australian Election\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of the Greens a third force in Australian electoral politics,\n",
    "especially in the House of Representatives presents new challenges and\n",
    "exposes the complicated nature of forecasting election results. First,\n",
    "Australia does not have a proportional electoral system. In many\n",
    "countries like Germany and New Zealand candidates are elected through\n",
    "proportional representation, which means that parties are allocated a\n",
    "certain number of members in parliament proportional to the percentage\n",
    "of the vote they received, (with some quirks in each system, of course).\n",
    "This system has the benefit that predicting seat outcomes is easy, if an\n",
    "accurate guess of the voting percentages is made. By contrast, Australia\n",
    "uses a single-member electorate system. Each electorate holds its own\n",
    "election, meaning that the national vote (which polls are designed to\n",
    "capture) is not necessarily reflective of seat outcomes. In 1998, the\n",
    "ALP received a majority in the TPP and the largest primary vote, but the\n",
    "Coalition won majority government. One usual work around is to use\n",
    "polling in order to calculate a national swing, how much have the\n",
    "national votes changed across the nation since the previous election?\n",
    "Then apply this swing to each individual electorate from the previous\n",
    "electorate (this is called a uniform swing). The ABC's Antony Green\n",
    "publishes a pendulum, which shows how much the TPP needs to swing in one\n",
    "direction to change the government - using this uniform swing approach.\n",
    "While this approach is successful in TPP contests, the growing size of\n",
    "non-major parties has rendered it less useful then before. Albeit it\n",
    "still remains a strong indicator of public support for/against the\n",
    "government. Therefore, there needs to be a consideration of the\n",
    "Australian electoral system as it really is, a preferential system\n",
    "designed to accommodate multi-party democracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting that includes a detailed model of the preferential system is\n",
    "important. First, it is reflective of the electoral system that\n",
    "Australia uses and therefore, more likely to be accurate. Secondly, the\n",
    "2022 election shows that as the major parties decline, the preferences\n",
    "become more important. At the next election Labor could lose more votes\n",
    "to the Greens but still form majority government (even gain seats). In\n",
    "the wake, of Anthony Albanese's election conservative pundits declared\n",
    "that the preferential voting system was unfair (failing to realise it\n",
    "was originally established to prevent Labor from winning). Education\n",
    "about the importance of preferences and that winning a preferential\n",
    "election even with a small share is legitimate is importance for trust\n",
    "in Australian democracy. And while pundits were wrong to question the\n",
    "validity of the result on the back of losing an election, questions\n",
    "about our system do remain. For example, what are the tangible\n",
    "differences between compulsory (federal) and optional (state)\n",
    "preferential voting, and do we require minimum vote shares in order to\n",
    "elect candidates? For example, a candidate with only 2 primary votes\n",
    "could theoretically win an election against an opponent with 1000\n",
    "primary votes if 999 other voters preferenced the first candidate above\n",
    "the second (and all the stars aligned in terms of other candidates vote\n",
    "share). Is this a fair result or should we require, where possible, that\n",
    "a minimum levels of primary vote support be required in order to be\n",
    "elected. In Germany, parties are required to win 5% of the national vote\n",
    "in order to win seats in the Bundestag, or win at least 3 local member\n",
    "seats, with the belief that this stops extremist parties from being\n",
    "unduly elected. Should Australia consider this sort of \\\"safeguard\\\"\n",
    "against extremist parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions require that the public have a better understanding of\n",
    "the electoral system they live in. Developing forecast and models that\n",
    "then allow political journalists to provide better explanation to the\n",
    "public is one way of achieving this.\n",
