# Plans For the second draft of the neural net

1. Create a balancing function that makes seat outcomes balanced
    - i.e: needs to make sure that there are equal number of labor wins, liberal wins, green wins, independent wins etc
    - IMPLEMENTED: Seems BALANCING DATA HAS NO NOTICEABLE EFFECTS - MIGHT BE WORSE
2. Include data from previous elections
3. Be able to save net so it doesn't need to be trained anymore
4. Use division data (i.e 2cp data from the divisions and weight to be equal to polling booth data)
5. Develop accuracy function
